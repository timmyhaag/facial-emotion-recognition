# Facial Emotion Recognition
Facial emotion recognition is investigated by developing a machine 
learning approach that can recognize various emotional states of users from facial expressions in the context 
of multimodal forms of user interactions. 

To examine this, a decision tree is implemented through Python on a dataset of multimodal facial expressions. This will be used to identify the emotional states of happiness, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, and surprise. In addition to a decision tree, a Support Vector Machine and Naive Bayes algorithm will be implemented to analyze the performance of each of these machine learning algorithms on the provided dataset. The Support Vector Machine will be implemented with a Linear kernel and Radial Basis Function kernel.

The provided dataset will consist of multimodal facial expressions of image data. The image data consists of 48x48 pixel grayscale images of a variety of facial expressions. In addition, the training set that will be used contains 28,709 samples. In the dataset, 0 will represent angry, 1 represents disgust, 2 represents fear, 3 represents sadness, 4 represents happiness, and 5 represents surprised. A decision tree, Support Vector Machine, and Naive Bayes algorithm will be implemented on the dataset to identify different emotions. The performance between each of these algorithms will be tested and compared to determine their efficiency.
